# Reddit Anti-scroll

Chrome extension for disabling scroll feeds on Reddit home and subreddit pages - without disabling other useful features of the site (individual comment pages, navigated to via Google for example).

Inspired by [Unhook for Youtube](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/unhook-remove-youtube-rec/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid?hl=en-US&utm_source=ext_sidebar).
